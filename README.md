Heart-Disease-Predictor
Overview
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease using a Logistic Regression model. It aims to alert patients about potential risks associated with heart disease, which is increasingly prevalent across all age groups.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CEql-OEexf9p02M5vCC1RDLXibHYE9Xz/view. The dataset includes several features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved during exercise, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia.

Model
The model utilizes Logistic Regression, a supervised learning algorithm suitable for binary classification problems. After exploring other methods like Random Forest and feature scaling, Logistic Regression was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in this context.

Challenges
During development, several challenges were encountered, including issues with feature scaling and model selection. However, these challenges were overcome by focusing on the core objective of using Logistic Regression for prediction.
